# BLuetooth-controlled-3-DOF-Arm-Robot-
This is a project which features the development of 3DOF arm robot consisting of the bluetooth code for the robot controlled via a HC05 bluetooth module.
This is a very preliminary experiment developed with limited resources and research time on the code.
The philosophy of the project is to combine parts used in additive manufacturing with convetionally manufactured metal parts.

The Robot uses a NEMA 17 stepper for actuation.
Which is controlled using a Tb6600 stepper motor driver commonly used in Industry grade machines such as CNC milling, routing machines and are also used for controlling big stepper motors.
The wireless commuication is achieved via a bluetooth HC05 module.
The project supports any microcontroller, provided the stepper motor driver goes hand to hand.
This is a low budget project which anyone can develop in their past time using a hobbyist 3D printer.
